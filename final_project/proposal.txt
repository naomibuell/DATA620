For our project, we'll analyze Steam game reviews for some of the top 100 best selling games to explore how factors such as game genre, release date, and user demographics impact reviews. We'll use web scraping techniques to collect review data from Steam's platform, followed by data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the dataset is suitable for analysis. With our data cleaned up, we’ll perform a network analysis on reviewers to see if there are any “super” reviewers among them.
