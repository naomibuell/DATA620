    "*1. Load a graph database of your choosing from a text file or other source.  If you take a large network dataset from the web (such as from [Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/)), please feel free at this point to load just a small subset of the nodes and edges.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Create basic analysis on the graph, including the graphâ€™s diameter, and at least one other metric of your choosing. You may either code the functions by hand (to build your intuition and insight), or use functions in an existing package.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Use a visualization tool of your choice (Neo4j, Gephi, etc.) to display information.*\n",

    "*4. Please record a short video (~ 5 minutes), and submit a link to the video in advance of our meet-up.*"
